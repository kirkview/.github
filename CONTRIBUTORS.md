# Contributors

This file is specifically for contributors to the [.github][repository] repository. All other repositories should
maintain their own `CONTRIBUTORS.md` file specific to those projects. We do not record organization-wide contributor
details.

All contributions follow the [all-contributors][all-contributors] guidelines for recognition.
