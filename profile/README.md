# Welcome

Kirkview is a Homeowners Association based out of Marietta, GA in the United States. We are a small community of homes
that try to offer exceptional services to our members, such as informative websites, live weather data for irrigation
and gardening, and more. This GitHub organization stores our private repositories for such projects, and is only
available to approved individuals within the community and contributors.

# Get in Touch

Whether you are a member of the community that would like to get involved in our technical projects, or someone that is
looking to learn more about the Kirkview community, you can find out everything [on our website][kirkview].
